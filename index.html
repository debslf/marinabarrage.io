<p> The <b> Marina Barrage </b> is a dam in Singapore built at the confluence of five rivers, across the Marina Channel between Marina East and Marina South. First conceptualised in 1987 but the late Lee Kuan Yew, the Barrage started construction on 22nd March 2005, and was officially opened on 31st October 2008 as Singapore's fifteenth reservoir. It provides water storage, flood control and recreation. It won a Superior Achievement Award from the American Academy of Environmental Engineers in 2009.</p>
